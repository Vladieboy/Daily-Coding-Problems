// The 24 game is played as follows. You are given a list of four integers, 
//each between 1 and 9, in a fixed order. By placing the operators +, -, *, and / between the numbers, 
//and grouping them with parentheses, determine whether it is possible to reach the value 24.

// For example, given the input [5, 2, 7, 8], you should return True, since (5 * 2 - 7) * 8 = 24.

// Write a function that plays the 24 game.
